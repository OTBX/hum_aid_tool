# hum_aid_tool
A tool designed to identify gaps in humanitarian aid. The tool will focus on 3 of the 13 main cluster sectors used to gauge necessary actions to be taken during humanitarian relief.  The intent of the project is to start in the Sudanese countries and then scale the geometry and indicators to be useful worldwide.
